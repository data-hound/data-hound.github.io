## About Me
Hi. I am Anshuman Sabath. I am a Software Enginner aspiring to be a researcher. My broad interests in research lie in working at the intersection of Neuroscience and Machine Learning to understatnd the processes that lead to emergence of intelligence in natural and artificial networks. I am also passionate about developing assistive intelligence solutions that better help in diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions and diseases.

### Research Statement
My interest in understanding intelligence in artificial and natural (brain) neural networks stems from a belief that fundamentally similar laws of nature would be at play that leads to this emergent behavior from a network arrangement of simple processing units (perceptrons/neurons). Also, I firmly believe that one of the best uses of the advancements in artificial neural network design would be the application of such intelligence to add to the capabilities of human investigators into intelligence, and hence help unravel deeper mysteries about the functioning of the brain. Such discoveries could also subsequently lead to developing better neural networks, forming a positive feedback loop, and rapidly increasing understanding of intelligence. 

With the sophisticated artificial neural networks which have outperformed their human counterparts in some tasks, having a better understanding of how the network effects operate in such networks to engender intelligent behavior could also potentially provide a simulatory test bed which we can poke and prod to figure out how the natural neural networks work, and what and what not could work. With sufficient maturity, I believe the artificial neural networks also have the potential to be developed into replacements for natural neural networks for patients that suffer from brain damage due to any reason.
